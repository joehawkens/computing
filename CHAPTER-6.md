# Problem Solving

Now that we know the core principles of Software Engineering - it's time for application. This is where the problem solving method comes in; it should be used on **every** problem you encounter in your career, it should become second nature and used as a guiding force for every decision you make, hence why it gets its own chapter. The problem solving method is broken up into steps, there are several versions, but most of them cover the same things - my version has 5 steps:

```
1. Understand the Problem
    - Context
    - Issue
    - Reason for Solving
3. Research 
    - Read Documentation
    - Discuss with Teammates
    - Look for problem previously solved by someone online (Stack Overflow)
5. Plan a Solution
    - Write Psuedocode
    - Write Test (Prevent Regression)
7. Implementation
    - "Done is better than perfect"
9. Optimization
    - Improve Readability
    - Add Comments
    - Remove Duplication
    - Optimize time/space complexity
    - Add error handling
```

Let's start out with a problem so we can know firsthand how to approach it with these steps.

## Understand the Problem

When you first encounter an issue, it's best to know what you're dealing with - you could go right in and try to solve it outright, but you'll save yourself a lot of time and headache with preperation and understanding.
