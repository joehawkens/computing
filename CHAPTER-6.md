# Problem Solving

Now that we know the core principles of Software Engineering - it's time for application. This is where the problem solving method comes in; it should be used on **every** problem you encounter in your career, it should become second nature and used as a guiding force for every decision you make, hence why it gets its own chapter. The problem solving method is broken up into steps, there are several versions, but most of them cover the same things - my version has 5 steps:

```
1. Understand the Problem
    - Context
    - Issue
    - Reason for Solving
2. Research 
    - Read Documentation
    - Discuss with Teammates
    - Look for problem previously solved by someone online (Stack Overflow)
3. Plan a Solution
    - Write Psuedocode
    - Write Tests (Prevent Regression)
4. Implementation
    - "Done is better than perfect"
5. Optimization
    - Improve Readability
    - Add Comments
    - Remove Duplication
    - Optimize time/space complexity
    - Add error handling
```


## Understand the Problem

Jumping right into an issue without first understanding limitations and context will make things difficult. Take time to truly understand the problem, so you know not only how to solve it, but how to optimize it later. The first step is creating a problem statement: this provides 1. context, 2. the main issue, and 3. The reason for solving, we'll use the following example to use in this framework:

* **Context:** We want to gather data about Earthquakes and other natural disasters from the web and put them on our webpage.
* **Issue:** Gathering all of that information from multiple sources and updating it will be difficult and time-consuming.
* **Reason for solving:** If we can fix the issue, we'll save time and money for implementing a solution.

Giving the problem context, identifying the issue, and knowing **why** you're doing something are critical because they help to facilitate greater confidence in step two of this process: Research
