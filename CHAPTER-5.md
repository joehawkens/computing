# Programming Lanugage Paradigms

This chapter aims to dig deeper into programming; we'll be doing this by exploring programming paradigms. A programming paradigm is a way to classify languages. The reason for doing this is to better understand the languages as tools, which can be utilized appropriately for the right problems. The most widley used paradigms you'll most likely encounter in industry are Imperative and Declarative:


## Imperative

Imperative coding is thinking like a computer - consider the following code:



## Declarative

Declarative is thinking like a human - consider the following code:

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE country='USA';
```
```CSS
.container{
  color: green;
 }
 ```
 ```HTML
 <h1>
      <h2>
          <p>
      <h2>
 <h1>
 ```
As you can see with these three examples, the code is human-friendly, if you showed this to a friend, some could venture a guess to its meaning - that's because you're declaring what is to be done, rather than having to define the consituents of meaning itself. It adds extra layers of abstraction - with these languages, you don't need to know how the 'SELECT' clause logic works, it simply performs its responsibility, same with HTML/CSS - the ".container" keyword has logic built into it, so you don't have to worry about what happens behind the scenes.
 
### Important note regarding Programming Paradigms:

There is a lot of controversy online of what makes something Declarative and something Imperative, since the only difference is abstraction - the line is blurred so much that one should view paradigms as a spectrum measuring human readability rather than distinct categories of one or the other. For example: when writing a loop in Python code, the way a variable is stored in registers is of no immediate concern to you, it has been abstracted away, and therefore could be considered declarative since it's more human-friendly code.

# Conclusion

In the end, all that matters is that you want a computer to do something - find a way to build it and do it. Even better - if you want to add value to society by creating something with Software, you can do it. Find a problem and get to work.
