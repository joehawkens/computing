# Programming Lanugage Paradigms

This chapter aims to dig deeper into programming; we'll be doing this by exploring programming paradigms - what they are, why we have them, and why you should know the difference. The most widley used paradigms you'll most likely encounter in industry are Imperative and Declarative:


## Imperative

Imperative coding is concerned with how something is done. Imagine a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board - your dot is on the top right of the board and you want it to make its way to the bottom left of the board, to do this the imperative way, you'd describe its movements: move two spaces down, two spaces to the left.


## Declarative

Declarative coding is concerned with what is done. Imagine the same 3x3 tic-tac-toe board - your dot is in the same location. Instead of focusing on how something is done, you're more worried about what is done - so you tell the dot to move 















# Conclusion

In the end, all that matters is that you want a computer to do something - find a way to build it and do it. Even better - if you want to add value to society by creating something with Software, you can do it. Find a problem and get to work.
