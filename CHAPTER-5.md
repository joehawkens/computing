# Programming Lanugage Paradigms

This chapter aims to dig deeper into programming; we'll be doing this by exploring programming paradigms - what they are, why we have them, and why you should know the difference. The most widley used paradigms you'll most likely encounter in industry are Imperative and Declarative:


## Imperative

Imperative coding is thinking like a computer - consider the following code:



## Declarative

Declarative is thinking like a human - consider the following code:

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE country='USA';
```

## Examples of Declarative and Imperative languages:









# Conclusion

In the end, all that matters is that you want a computer to do something - find a way to build it and do it. Even better - if you want to add value to society by creating something with Software, you can do it. Find a problem and get to work.
