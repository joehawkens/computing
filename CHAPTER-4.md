# Software Engineering

So the computer has recieved power from the elctrical grid, all computer hardware is running, so where does software begin to peak its head in this process?






Registers = the RAM of the CPU (temporary data storage for processing)


Elecricity --> (CPU Structure -        Logic Gates/Transitors (CPU) --> Machine Code (CPU)       ) --> Assembly Language --> Programming Languages

* The closer you are to the hardware, the more you'll have access to manipulating it.


(Compilers translate language to machine code)
(Assemblers translate Assembly to machine code)

P Language --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> CPU

Assembly Language --> Assembler --> Machine Code



Binary --> Hexadecimal (Condensed binary)
