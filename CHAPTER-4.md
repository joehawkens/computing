# Software Engineering

So the computer has recieved power from the elctrical grid, all computer hardware is running, so where does software begin to peak its head in this process? I didn't cover it in the last chapter, but the CPU processes data with something called "Machine Code" - this is the language used by all computers everywhere (Phones, Desktops, Spaceships) - you name it, if it's a computer, it runs Machine Code or Machine Language. These are the 1's and 0's used in the movies when hackers or computer nerds are featured on screen. This is universal with all computers, whether you're using apple or android.
