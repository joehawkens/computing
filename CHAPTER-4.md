# Software Engineering

So the computer has recieved power from the elctrical grid, all computer hardware is running, so where does software begin to peak its head in this process? I didn't cover it in the last chapter, but the CPU processes data with something called "Machine Code" - this is the language used by all computers everywhere (Phones, Desktops, Spaceships) - you name it, if it's a computer, it runs Machine Code or Machine Language. These are the 1's and 0's used in the movies when hackers or computer nerds are featured on screen.

Originally, scientists would program everything in Machine Code - when people started to get tired of having to program in binary (1001010101010110) - they came up with methods that streamlined the process, ushering in the first high-level, or human-readable, languages.



Order:

- Machine Language
- Assembler
- Assembly

- Machine Language
- Compiler
- High-level languages (Python, C++, Java)





Registers = the RAM of the CPU (temporary data storage for processing)


Elecricity --> (CPU Structure -        Logic Gates/Transitors (CPU) --> Machine Code (CPU)       ) --> Assembly Language --> Programming Languages

* The closer you are to the hardware, the more you'll have access to manipulating it. Software is on the outside shell.


(Compilers translate language to machine code)
(Assemblers translate Assembly to machine code)

P Language --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> CPU

Assembly Language --> Assembler --> Machine Code



Binary --> Hexadecimal (Condensed binary)
