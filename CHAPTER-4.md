So the computer has recieved power from the elctrical grid, all computer hardware is running, so where does software begin to peak its head in this process? I didn't cover it in the last chapter, but the CPU processes data with something called "Machine Code" - this is the language used by all computers everywhere (Phones, Desktops, Spaceships) - you name it, if it's a computer, it runs Machine Code or Machine Language or Binary. These are the 1's and 0's used in the movies when hackers or computer nerds are featured on screen. This is the universal language of computers, the reason being that you can represent electrical impulses by either a 1 (power ON) or a 0 (power off). These impulses work their magic within the logic gates of the computer to process information at the lowest level and perform calculations. This is computing in its purest form.

However, in order for humans to interact with these machines they needed to understand the language of the machine (Binary). As one could guess, this quickly led to frustration for many early programmers writing everything in machine code, which consisted of entirely 1's and 0's (ex: 0110101010). To combat this problem, researchers developed another language which allowed for easier reading - Assembly Language.
