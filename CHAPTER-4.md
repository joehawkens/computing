# Software Engineering

At the beginning of this tutorial I stated that I wouldn't be covering everything computers have to offer because of the sheer volume of information available, and because I only wanted to focus on relevant information for Software Engineers - I did this last chapter with computer engineering, the field has plentiful more to offer than just 6 components, each component individually has several layers of abstraction.


Registers = the RAM of the CPU (temporary data storage for processing)


Elecricity --> (CPU Structure -        Logic Gates/Transitors (CPU) --> Machine Code (CPU)       ) --> Assembly Language --> Programming Languages

* The closer you are to the hardware, the more you'll have access to manipulating it.


(Compilers translate language to machine code)
(Assemblers translate Assembly to machine code)

P Language --> Compiler --> Machine Code --> CPU

Assembly Language --> Assembler --> Machine Code



Binary --> Hexadecimal (Condensed binary)
