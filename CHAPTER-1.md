# Chapter 1: Abstraction

### What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is a concept that allows complexity to be simplified. A great example of Abstraction is when you go to wash your hands. All you see as the end user (customer) is going to the sink, turning the knob, and recieving cold or hot water. However, behind the scenes (where the water comes from, how it's processed, and where it goes) is "abstracted" away from your experience. You don't care about any of those things, your goal is to get water, and the turning of the knob is all that is required of you to get what you want. You wouldn't go out to a river, gather water, treat it with chemicals, and head back home every time you want a glass of water. Unless you're living off grid, the system is already in place and there to serve you.

Computers are no different. There are systems in place, abstracted away, to help create a better experience for us at the end of the line. The levels of Abstraction for computers can be viewed here in the diagram below. The headings for each level of abstraction are specialties that overlap with each other, for example: Physics overlaps with Electrical Engineering (EE), as a basic understanding of Physics is necessary to understand the properties of electricity and integrate them into circuitry. And Computer Engineers need a solid foundation in EE to properly piece together hardware for efficient computers. Software Engineers should understand how data is formed within a computer's hardware to know how their software is affected. Each level builds on one another.

The reason Abstraction is set as this chapter's heading is because once you understand Abstraction, you can better understand your purpose as a Software Engineer. When you're programming and you run into problems, digging deeper into the levels of abstraction gives you a more comprehensive understanding of how your software works and the best way to optimize it, further improving your problem solving skills.
