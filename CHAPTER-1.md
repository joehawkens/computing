# Chapter 1: Abstraction

### What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is a concept that allows complexity to be simplified. A great example of Abstraction is when you go to wash your hands. All you see as the end user (customer) is going to the sink, turning the knob, and recieving cold or hot water. However, behind the scenes (where the water comes from, how it's processed, and where it goes) is "abstracted" away from your experience. You don't care about any of those things, your goal is to get water, and the turning of the knob is all that is required of you to get what you want. You wouldn't go out to a river, gather water, treat it with chemicals, and head back home every time you want a glass of water. Unless you're living off grid, the system is already in place and there to serve you.

Computers are no different. There are systems in place, abstracted away, to help create a better experience for us at the end of the line. The levels of Abstraction for computers can be viewed here in this diagram:
