# Chapter 1: Abstraction

### What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is a concept that allows complexity to be simplified. A great example of Abstraction is when you go to wash your hands. All you see as the end user (customer) is going to the sink, turning the knob, and recieving cold or hot water. However, behind the scenes (where the water comes from, how it's processed, and where it goes) is "abstracted" away from your experience. You don't care about any of those things, your goal is to get water, and the turning of the knob is all that is required of you to get what you want.
