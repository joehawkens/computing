# Design Patterns

In Programming you'll run into a lot of different problems. As a beginner, you'll view all of them as unique issues. However, after more exposure over the years you'll realize that a lot of these problems are nothing more than a flavor of a universal problem encountered by all developers. Once this realization happens it's good for an experienced developer to begin understanding design patters - blueprints to implement on these universal problems.

Design Patterns first started with Object-Oriented languages, such as C++ - most likely due to the fact that OOP reigns supreme as the industry favorite, but have since been implemented within other paradigms. There are tens of patterns, and the are categorized into three labels:

## Creational

Creational patterns are concerned with the creation mechanism of an object and focus on re-usability and flexibility.

## Structural

Strutural patters are concerned with the way, you guessed it, a program is structured.

## Behavioral

Behavioral is the state of the program. In the case of OOP - it's the concern for the communication of objects.


## Conclusion:

Knowing design patterns isn't the most important thing to know as a developer, but something that will be understood over time, after several years of encountering the same problems you'll begin to notice patterns of problems that have similarly patterned solutions, although it takes a great understanding of programming to get to that level.
