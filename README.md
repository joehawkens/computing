# Chapter 0: Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you how computers work by understanding their fundamental building blocks, in turn, it's hoped that from understanding the fundamentals at a low level, you'll have a clearer understanding of how things work at a high level (programming). This tutorial is aimed to help Software Engineers have a more complex understanding of the systems they work with on a daily basis.

The tutorial aims to cover a wide range of topics, and although it hopes to cover essential concepts, it won't cover everything computers have to offer - merely the information relevant to Software Engineers.
