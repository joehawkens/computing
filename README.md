# Chapter 0: Overview

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you how computers work by understanding their fundamental building blocks, in turn, it's hoped that from understanding the fundamentals at a low level, you'll have a clearer understanding of how things work at a high level (programming). This tutorial is aimed to help Software Engineers have a more complex understanding of the systems they work with on a daily basis.

The tutorial will be cut into 5 chapters. After this overview, we'll cover the principle of Abstraction and the fields of specialty within each level, following that it will dive into each speciality individually. Special knowledge about each level will carry over to the next and end at chapter 4 where all critical concepts needed for a comprehensive understanding are woven together to give Software Engineers a better knowledge of the systems they work with and, in turn, help them make better software themselves. The tutorial ends with Chapter 5, which goes deeper into Software Engineering.

The tutorial aims to cover a wide range of topics, and although it hopes to cover essential concepts, it won't cover everything computers have to offer - merely the information relevant to Software Engineers.
