## How do computers work?

The short answer: Computers harness the power of electricity using sophisticated hardware, the fluctuation of power from this electricity (ON/OFF) is then further used to create binary code. This Binary, also known as Machine Code, is processed further to create meaningful data, which in turn produces programming language, or huaman-readable code.
