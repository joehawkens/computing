# Chapter 2: Electricity

Electricity is the blood of a computer system, providing life to all of its internal structure, hence why it's important to understand its functions inside of a computer.

## Where does Electricity come from?

Most countries have some form of a grid system that distrbutes electricity to the public. It all begins with how the energy is generated (Solar, Wind, Nuclear, etc.) - then this power is converted into Electrical energy. Once converted, it's voltage is amped up at the plant where it was produced (to increase efficiency in transport) and travels to cities and towns where there are transformers (created by Electrical Engineers) that lower the voltage and safely distribute it among homes. It's important to remember that at the beginnning of this process, the high voltage produced from plants can't immediately be distributed to the public. The raw high voltage would fry any home appliances, hence why there are transformers to lower the voltage to an appropriate level before distribution to consumer's homes

## How is Electricity transferred into a computer?

When you plug your computer into the wall, you're actually plugging in something called a Power Supply Unit (PSU). This is the first piece of computer hardward that guides us into the world of computer engineering. It's purpose is to convert the Alternating Current (AC) form of electricty from the wall to Direct Current (DC) - The reason there needs to be a switch of current is because computers work linearly, meaning that everything functions in order (1. 2. 3.), which requires a constant stream forward, instead of the forward and backward motion of Alternating Current.

## Chapter 2 Summary:

To summarize: Electricity comes from a grid system created by Electrical Engineers. The power is generated, converted, transported, and distributed to the general public. Once this electricity reaches your home it is then processed by a Power Supply Unit (PSU) connected to your computer - which further converts the electricity to  allow compatibility within your hardware, giving your computer life (power).
