# Chapter 2: Physics - Electricity

This will be the shortest chapter because although Physics has its place in computing, knowing how Electricity behaves and contributes to the overall system of a computer is of little help to a Software Engineer, unless you're designing sophisticated weapons of mass destruction or rockets for NASA with a low-level language, but even then, you're dipping into the scope of Computer and Electrical Engineering if you did.

That being said, the bare minimum you need to know to understand how Electricity fits into the big picture is the way it is transferred into a computer. Electricity is the blood of the machine, knowing where it comes from and its function inside of a computer is basic knowledge every Software Engineer should have.

## Where does Electricity come from?

Most countries have some form of a grid system that distrbutes electricity to the public. It all begins with how the energy is generated (Solar, Wind, Nuclear, etc.) - then this power is converted into Electrical energy. Once converted, it's voltage is amped up at the plant where it was produced (to increase efficiency in transport) and travels to cities and towns where there are transformers that lower the voltage and safely distribute it among homes. It's important to remember that at the beginnning of this process, the high voltage produced from plants can't immediately be distributed to the public. The raw high voltage would fry any home appliance, hence why there are transformers to lower the voltage to an appropriate level before distribution.
